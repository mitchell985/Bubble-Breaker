# Bubble-Breaker

A cool Bubble Breaker game I made in university. A cloned of the game that use to be on Windows Moblie Phones.

Uses Apache Derby Database to keep track of score. Has the backend game that can run in the console, and the seperate gui that runs on top.

## Run it

To run the GUI version download Bubble_Breaker.jar from dist/Bubble_Breaker.jar and run it. (With the Java JDK installed...)

To run the CUI version download CUI.jar from dist/CUI.jar and run it. (Also with the Java JDK installed...) To get colour working you may need to set Colour: true in score.breaker, when the file is created after running the jar for the first time.
